## ðŸ“– Description
Graph Coloring is a combinatorial optimization problem where colors are assigned to graph vertices so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. It has applications in scheduling, register allocation, and network optimization. Traditional solutions include greedy algorithms, backtracking, and metaheuristic approaches like Genetic Algorithms and Simulated Annealing. Since the problem is NP-hard, finding optimal solutions efficiently remains a challenge.
